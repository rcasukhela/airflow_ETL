This is a demo recording my study of Airflow, a popular orchestration tool that can be used for ETL.

The demo includes:
* A local Windows implementation of Kerry Wang's guide (https://intuitivedataguide.medium.com/building-a-simple-etl-with-airflow-postgresql-and-docker-a2b1a2b202ec) and GitHub (https://github.com/sevkw/airflow-etl/tree/master).
* My cobbled-together implementation of Discord Webhooks as an alternative to emails upon success, execution, and failure
* A rudimentary understanding of CRON job notation
* A basic understanding of how to execute Python functions and CRUD operations on a Postgres database.
